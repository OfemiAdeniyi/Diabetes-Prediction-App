# ğŸ©º Diabetes Prediction App
## ğŸ“˜ Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health indicators.
The app leverages the XGBoost algorithm for prediction and provides a clean, interactive interface for users to input their health parameters and receive instant results.

This project demonstrates the integration of data science, machine learning, and web app deployment to address a real-world healthcare challenge â€” early detection of diabetes.

## ğŸš€ Features

ğŸ“Š Interactive User Interface: Simple and intuitive input sidebar for entering personal health details.

ğŸ¤– Machine Learning Model: Utilizes XGBoost Classifier trained on a diabetes dataset.

ğŸ§  Accurate Predictions: Predicts whether a user is likely diabetic or non-diabetic.

ğŸ’¡ Probability Insights: Displays confidence levels for both outcomes.
