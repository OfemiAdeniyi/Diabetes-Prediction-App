# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction App
## 📘 Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key health indicators.
The app leverages the XGBoost algorithm for prediction and provides a clean, interactive interface for users to input their health parameters and receive instant results.

This project demonstrates the integration of data science, machine learning, and web app deployment to address a real-world healthcare challenge — early detection of diabetes.

## 🚀 Features

📊 Interactive User Interface: Simple and intuitive input sidebar for entering personal health details.

🤖 Machine Learning Model: Utilizes XGBoost Classifier trained on a diabetes dataset.

🧠 Accurate Predictions: Predicts whether a user is likely diabetic or non-diabetic.

💡 Probability Insights: Displays confidence levels for both outcomes.
Dataset

## The model is trained on the Diabetes Prediction Dataset, which includes the following features:

Gender, Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History, BMI, HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level

Target Variable:
diabetes — Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

🧠 Model Training

The app uses:

XGBoost Classifier for prediction.

Label Encoding for categorical variables.

Train-test split to evaluate model performance.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
